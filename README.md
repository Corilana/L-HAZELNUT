# HazelnutFSPM

This is the PhD project of Francesca.

AIM: build a coarse FSPM of hazelnut.

HAZELNUT DESCRIPTION:
-bushy plants;
-4 types of buds:
  -M: mixed buds. they are preformed buds that during the season develop into a little shoot with at the end the nut;
  -C: catkins (male flower). they are sylleptic shoots bearing male flowers.
  -B: blind nodes;
  -V: vegetative buds. they develop into shoots
-there can be multiple buds per node (usually when there are catkins) 
 
DATASET:
-1: recording of 2020 bud fate, length, diameter, number of nodes of 1yo shoots;
-2: recording of bud fate, lenght, diameter, number of nodes of 1yo shoots born on the shoots analyzed in 2020


STEP1 (meeting 21/10/2021): 

-analyze bud fate data according to the shoot length category (Sh, Me, Lo, VLo);
  -are the zone homogeneus? 
  -is there a common zone composition that is shorter or longer depending on the lenght?
 
 -let Francesca training with data using some easier old dataset
